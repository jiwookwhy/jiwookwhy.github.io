# About Me

Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to share a little about myself here.

### Features:
* Mobile-first design ensures this theme performs fastest on mobile while scaling elegantly to desktop-size screens.
* Designed for blogs and sites heavy on written content, with bold typography styles, homepage summaries, and previous/next snippets.
* Supports a wide range of HTML elements and markdown.
* Flexible styles that can be reused for customization without adding additional CSS.
* Dynamically generated navigation links. See docs below for adding pages with specific post category for-loops.

## Themes
This theme comes in two color variations. The default is set to the `light` theme. To change the theme color, add `theme_color:` to your `config.yml` file with the color you wish to use. Example: `theme_color: dark`.

<!-- | Config setting | Thumbnail |
| --- | --- |
| `theme_color: black` | <img width="330" alt="black" src="url"> |
| `theme_color: red` | <img width="330" alt="red" src="url"> | -->
And add this line to your Jekyll site `config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-athena
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-athena
