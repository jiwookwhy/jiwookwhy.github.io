I grew up splitting my childhood between O'hau, Hawaii and San Diego, California. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2018 with degrees in applied mathematics, statistics, and economics. Following graduation, I worked for 2 years at the Federal Reserve Board's International Finance division after which I started my PhD program at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke Univerisity. My research interests include options/derivatives pricing, factor modeling, and the relationship between market pricing and macroeconomic risk.
