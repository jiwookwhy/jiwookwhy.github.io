    <p>This paper comprehensively examines variance risk premia across a variety of asset classes by studying straddles written on these assets. I decompose straddles into a volatility risk asset and a jump risk asset to examine the pricing of jumps and expected volatility in the options market around pre-scheduled macroeconomic annoucements.

    <p>Equity index options with less than one month to maturity have surged in popularity over the past two decades, particularly for the very shortest maturities. S&P 500 (SPX) options with fewer than 10 days to maturity represented 17% of all SPX option trading volume in 1996 as compared to around 70% today. Despite this popularity, research on such short maturities remains limited. In this paper, I examine deleveraged daily returns to short maturity contracts written on three major U.S. indices: S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000. I estimate Instrumental Principal Components Analysis factor models and find evidence for a low-dimensional factor structure that explains over 95% of the variation in the cross-section of option returns. I apply two complementary approaches to interpret the latent factors and conclude they primarily provide compensation for exposure to the forward-looking higher-order moments of these indices, namely risk-neutral variance and skewness. Based on this interpretation, I propose a tradable factor model which outperforms previously proposed models from the literature and industry practice. Using this factor model, I quantify the contributions to the expected return for options with various levels of moneyness, maturity, and type (call/put) from exposure to the underlying index, variance, and skewness. I document substantial contributions to the expected return from exposure to these higher-order moments, with significant variation across moneyness, maturity and type.  </p>

    <p> The quality of a country's legal institutions is an important source of comparative advantage, yet few studies look at how this source of comparative advantage develops over time. Using export data from 1996 - 2016, I examine the intertemporal effect of an improvement in a country's legal institutions on its export composition. I do this by exploiting variation in the quality of these institutions prompted by the conditionality of European Union membership. </p>
