    <a href="https://github.com/jiwookwhy/Var_swaps">Learning Exotics with Reinforcement Learning</a>
    <p>This project develops a training framework for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to price deriatives with exotic payoffs given option prices on the underlying. As a proof of concept, I train agents to price a variance swap given a set of European-style options on the underlying as input. A variance swap is a deriative with payoff equal to the realized variance of an underlying asset up to a pre-defined maturity date. The RL agent is trained in the OpenAI gymnasium which provides a standardized API for training reinforcement learning agents.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/jiwookwhy/Static-Hedging-NN">A neutral network approach to the static hedging of options</a>
    <p> Static hedging of equity index derivatives using nearby contracts using feed-forward neural networks. Two neural networks (an evaluation network and a policy network) take as input a target option to hedge and jointly return a set of three nearby option contracts on the volatility surface and portfolio weights such that the portfolio formed by these nearby with the returned weights hedges price fluctations in the target option over a user-defined holding period. It performs similiarly to other modern static hedging algorithms in the literature such as those devloped by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfec/article/15/1/1/2548347">Wu and Zhu (2016)</a> or <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfec/article/12/1/3/815302">Carr and Wu (2013)</a> and outperforms standard Black-Scholes delta hedging in the presence of jumps in the underlying. </p>

    <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5122949">Vent ML: A decision support tool for ICU physicians </a>
    <p>This decision support tool is designed to help clinicians assess a patient's readiness to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation assists patients in breathing via a tube inserted into the trachea, ensuring adequate oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. Clinicians may struggle to determine the appropriate sedation level and ventilation support, particularly for critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities. The tool utilizes deep Q-learning to train an algorithm that selects the optimal action based on the patient's clinical state and available options. It was trained on the large scale MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database, one of the few publicly available, de-identified, and large scale datasets containing the entire electronic health records (EHR), including vitals time series, medication dosages, procedures, and physician notes, from actual ICU patients admitted to the Beth Deaconess medical center (Boston, MA) between 2001-2012. The data consist of 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients (ages 16 and older) and 7,870 neonates admitted to the neonate intensive care unit.  </p>
