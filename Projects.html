    <a href="https://github.com/jiwookwhy/Var_swaps">Learning Exotics with Reinforcement Learning</a>
    <p>This project develops a training framework for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to price deriatives with exotic payoffs given option prices on the underlying. As a proof of concept, I train agents to price a variance swap given a set of European-style options on the underlying as input. A variance swap is a deriative with payoff equal to the realized variance of an underlying asset up to a pre-defined maturity date. The RL agent is trained in the OpenAI gymnasium which provides a standardized API for training reinforcement learning agents.</p>

    <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5122949">Vent ML: A decision support tool for ICU physicians </a>
    <p>A decision support tool aimed at practicing clinicians facing the difficult problem of evaluating a patient's readiness to be weaned off of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation involves assisting a patient breathe via a tube inserted into a patient's trachea to ensure adequate oxygenation and removal of excess carbon dioxide from the lungs. It is paired with sedation to make the presence of the tube tolerable. It is a mainstay procedure in intensive care units (ICUs) in the U.S.; however, despite its ubiquity, practicing clinicians may find the correct choice of sedation level and mechanical ventilation support hard to precisely determine. This is especially true for critically ill patients, who often have multiple comorbidities and whose clinical condition may not easily fit into existing clinical protocols. This decision support tool employs deep Q-learning to train an algorithm to select an optimal action given both information about the patient's clinical state and a set of available action choices. It was trained on the large scale MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database, one of the few publicly available, de-identified, and large scale datasets containing the entire electronic health records (EHR), including vitals time series, medication dosages, procedures, and physician notes, from actual ICU patients admitted to the Beth Deaconess medical center (Boston, MA) between 2001-2012. The data consist of 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients (ages 16 and older) and 7,870 neonates admitted to the neonate intensive care unit.  </p>

    <p> The quality of a country's legal institutions is an important source of comparative advantage, yet few studies look at how this source of comparative advantage develops over time. Using export data from 1996 - 2016, I examine the intertemporal effect of an improvement in a country's legal institutions on its export composition. I do this by exploiting variation in the quality of these institutions prompted by the conditionality of European Union membership. </p>
